This project is abandoned because I made it when I was a python programming noob and it is extremely inefficient.

BEFORE YOU GET PISSED AT ME:
I created this using debian 10. I have heard it does not work too well on windows. From what I have heard, it just doesn't do anything. 
However, in the future I will be creating a much better and faster gui raiding tool that can be used on windows. 

destroyer of discord servers

btw a lot of this shit is against the ToS

HOW TO USE spambotv9.py (for dumbasses):

First, download the .py file, make sure you have the modules installed.


Replace the INSERT TOKEN HERE with your bot token, which can be obtained in the developer api.

(you need to create a bot in the api first)


in the Oauth2 bar, scroll down to the checkbox and click bot. Another new checkbox should appear below.

Scroll down again. Click administrator in this checkbox.

Then, go back to the top checkbox and copy the link.

You can paste the link into your browser to invite the bot to a discord server that you have bot invite privileges on.

If you don't have invite privileges, you can still give the link to a server owner/admin and tell them "it is a moderation bot" or something

If the server owner/admin is dumb enough, they will add the bot to the server


When you are ready, type this into the command line (replace filename with the files name):

python3 filename.py

The bot will begin running and any message in the discord server will start the bot spam pinging.


It is most effective when you type messages into every channel possible to get the bot spamming everyone in more than one channel

It may not work if the bot gets reported (in this case, just make a new bot) or you are banned from the discord developer api

ALWAYS GET THE NEWEST VERSION OF THE BOT CODE IF POSSIBLE

EPIC FEATURES
-Spam-messages any channel that a message is sent in
-Spams admin logs
-Gives anyone who sends a message an admin role (super chaotic)
-Spam-creates roles until it reaches max (250)
-Spam-creates text channels until it reaches max (500)
-Changes its nickname and other users nicknames to random letters rapidly, making it exponentially harder to kick the bot
-Unbans anyone who gets banned
-Deletes all original text channels that people send messages in
~~~~~
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELFBOTS (for retarded skids who can barely read this):

IF YOU ARE USING singleuserspammer.py JUST PUT THE TOKEN IN THE FILE

IF YOU ARE USING multi-selfbot.py YOU MUST CREATE A FILE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY CALLED tokens.txt - IT SHOULD LIKE LIKE THIS WITH A TOKEN ON EACH LINE:

njnognsobneoiwr.gsrhwrhghe-srnrhwrhwrh

ewhteghtegrgrgwg.gwrhwrhrwh-gwrjyrytqegeh

fewrhwhwrhrw.grwhwrgwegh-ewheththegdg






ALSO, tokenfilter.py IS MEANT TO BE RUN IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS tokens.txt AND IT DELETES ALL OF THE INVALID ONES
